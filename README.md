# Scientific Computing Module Projects

This is the collection of my projects I worked on for the Scientific Computing module, a semester-long year 4 module that I took during my third year.

## Project List
* Lunar Lander
* Version Control (nearest neighbours)
* Signal Processing (coolest, in my opinion)
* Differential Equations
* Final Project (diffusion limited aggregation)

Read README inside each project folder for more detail.
